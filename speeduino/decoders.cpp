 * Crank and Cam decoders
 * 
 * This file contains the various crank and cam wheel decoder functions.
 * Each decoder must have the following 4 functions (Where xxxx is the decoder name):
 * 
 * - **triggerSetup_xxxx** - Called once from within setup() and configures any required variables
 * - **triggerPri_xxxx** - Called each time the primary (No. 1) crank/cam signal is triggered (Called as an interrupt, so variables must be declared volatile)
 * - **triggerSec_xxxx** - Called each time the secondary (No. 2) crank/cam signal is triggered (Called as an interrupt, so variables must be declared volatile)
 * - **getRPM_xxxx** - Returns the current RPM, as calculated by the decoder
 * - **getCrankAngle_xxxx** - Returns the current crank angle, as calculated by the decoder
 * - **getCamAngle_xxxx** - Returns the current CAM angle, as calculated by the decoder
 *
 * Each decoder must utilise at least the following variables:
 * 
 * - toothLastToothTime - The time (In uS) that the last primary tooth was 'seen'
 */

/* Notes on Doxygen Groups/Modules documentation style:
 * - Installing doxygen (e.g. Ubuntu) via pkg mgr: sudo apt-get install doxygen graphviz
 * - @defgroup tag name/description becomes the short name on (Doxygen) "Modules" page
 * - Relying on JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF (in Doxyfile, essentially automatic @brief), the first sentence (ending with period) becomes
 *   the longer description (second column following name) on (Doxygen) "Modules" page (old Desc: ... could be this sentence)
 * - All the content after first sentence (like old Note:...) is visible on the page linked from the name (1st col) on "Modules" page
 * - To group all decoders together add 1) @defgroup dec Decoders (on top) and 2) "@ingroup dec" to each decoder (under @defgroup)
 * - To compare Speeduino Doxyfile to default config, do: `doxygen -g Doxyfile.default ; diff Doxyfile.default Doxyfile`
