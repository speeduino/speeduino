 * @author Josh Stewart
 * 
 * This file contains the main system loop of the Speeduino core and thus much of the logic of the fuel and ignition algorithms is contained within this
 * It is where calls to all the auxiliary control systems, sensor reads, comms etc are made
 * 
 * It also contains the setup() function that is called by the bootloader on system startup

 * Eg:
 *  - Pri injectors are 250cc
 *  - Sec injectors are 500cc
 *  - Total injector capacity = 750cc

 *  - staged_req_fuel_mult_pri = 300% (The primary injectors would have to run 3x the overall PW in order to be the equivalent of the full 750cc capacity
 *  - staged_req_fuel_mult_sec = 150% (The secondary injectors would have to run 1.5x the overall PW in order to be the equivalent of the full 750cc capacity
